## Hi there 👋

I am Guillaume, a full-stack developer living in Luxembourg.

📚 Being self-taught, I believe in life-long learning and knowledge sharing. 
I also deeply believe in the open-source movement and try to give back to the community whenever I can.

### My work 👨‍💻

I am currently working on [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com), a desktop API mocking application. It's the quickest and easiest way to create a local [mock API](https://mockoon.com). No account or remote deployment is needed. And it's open-source!

You can support my work on Mockoon by becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/255kb).
